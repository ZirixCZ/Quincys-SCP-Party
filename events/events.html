    <div class="event-li-div">
        <h1 id="event1-upper" class="upper"><span>PeanutRun</span></h1>
        <li id="event1-lower" class="lower">Everyone on the server is spawned as an SCP-173 in the normal spawn location. All doors in the facility are locked open, and the Peanuts must run for the exit while the Alpha Warhead counts down to their death. Anyone who makes it to the surface and survives the nuke, wins.</li>

        <h1 id="event2-upper" class="upper"><span>TeamDeathmatch</span></h1>
        <li id="event2-lower" class="lower">Half of the server will spawn as Chaos Insurgency, and half of the server as MTF Commanders. They must fight eachother on the surface. Who will win, the MTF with their higher health, or the Chaos, with their natural high ground above their spawn?</li>

        <h1 id="event3-upper" class="upper"><span>HidenSeek</span></h1>
        <li id="event3-lower" class="lower">All players (save a few randomly selected ones choosen as SCP's) will spawn as Class-D in the SCP-096 spawn room. They will need to find hiding places within Heavy-Containment Zone, as the SCP's attempt to find and kill all of them. The last surviving Class-D is the winner of the round.</li>

        <h1 id="event4-upper" class="upper"><span>Dodgeball</span></h1>
        <li id="event4-lower" class="lower">Everyone on the server will spawn as a Class-D inside of a small room. Every few seconds, a number of SCP-018's, or grenades, will spawn in the room in random locations moving in random directions. The last Class-D alive is the winner.</li>

        <h1 id="event5-upper" class="upper"><span>Outbreak</span></h1>
        <li id="event5-lower" class="lower">Most players will spawn normally, as Class-D, Scientists, Guards, etc. However, all SCP's on the server will spawn as "Alpha Zombies". These zombies (by default) will spawn with a much larger than normal health pool, and be able to break down locked doors. During the round, anyone who takes damage from an SCP-049-2 will have a (by default 80%) chance to be infected with SCP-008. While infected, they will slowly lose health until they heal, or die. If a player dies while infected, they will turn into a normal SCP-049-2, and be tasked with helping the alphas spread the infection and kill everyone.</li>

        <h1 id="event6-upper" class="upper"><span>Juggernaut</span></h1>
        <li id="event6-lower" class="lower">All players on the server (save a single randomly selected one to be the Juggernaut) will spawn as MTF Commanders on the surface. The Juggernaut will spawn as a Chaos Insurgency in SCP-939's spawn. The MTF will need to enter the facility and kill the Juggernaut. If they succeed, they win, if the Juggernaut is able to terminate all MTF Commanders before they respawn more, the Juggernaut wins.</li>

        <h1 id="event7-upper" class="upper"><span>Bloodbath</span></h1>
        <li id="event7-lower" class="lower">The entire server, save a few players selected at random to become SCP-173's, are spawned as Class-D in the Tutorial tower. After a few seconds, the SCP-173's will be teleported there to join and kill them. The SCP-173's will be given god mode, and low health. The last surviving Class-D is the winner.</li>

        <h1 id="event8-upper" class="upper"><span>Gungame</span></h1>
        <li id="event8-lower" class="lower">All players are spawn in random rooms in Light-Containment Zone, as Class-D with a single SCP-018. Their objective is to kill other players with their SCP-018, thus granting them a COM-15. Killing people with each gun time will further upgrade their weapon along the following scale: SCP-018 -> COM15 -> USP -> MP7 -> Logicer -> P90 -> E-11 -> Frag Grenade The first player who gets a kill with a Frag Grenade is the winner.</li>

        <h1 id="event9-upper" class="upper"><span>PeanutInfection</span></h1>
        <li id="event9-lower" class="lower">Everyone on the server (save a few randomly selected to be SCP-173s) are spawned as Class-D. The Peanuts are tasked with killing all of the Class-D, while the Class-D attempt to fight back any way they can. Whenever an SCP-173 kills a player, that player will turn into another, new SCP-173.</li>

        <h1 id="event10-upper" class="upper"><span>VIP</span></h1>
        <li id="event10-lower" class="lower">There is one VIP (Scientist). Guards (MTF) must escort the VIP to escape while Attackers (Chaos Insurgency) attempt to kill the VIP. The VIP has no respawns and increased health and armor.</li>
